# OptiPaw: Data-Driven Outcomes for Shelter Animals üêæ

This repository contains the **OptiPaw Project**, a data science initiative aimed at improving animal shelter outcomes. By analysing shelter data, we provide pet trends, predict adoption outcomes, and recommend tailored pet names.

---

## Problem
Every year, **7.6 million animals** enter U.S. shelters, and resources are often strained. This project addresses:
1. Efficient allocation of care.
2. Tailored adoption strategies.
3. Improved public engagement with data-driven insights.

---

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Trends in adoption and shelter stay duration.
  - Seasonal and regional adoption variations.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression, kNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks.
  - Dimensionality reduction using PCA.
  - Evaluative metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Log Loss.

- **Pet Name Recommendation System:**
  - Implements kNN with TF-IDF encoding and various distance metrics.
  - Generate 5 names for user to choose.

## How to Run

1. **Clone Repository**:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptiPaw.git
  ```

3. **Install Requirements**:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. **Run Scripts**:
- Data Cleaning:
  ```
  python src/data_cleaning/clean_data.py
  ```
- Train Models:
  ```
  python src/models/train_model.py
  ```
- Generate Recommendations:
  ```
  python src/recommendation/recommend.py
  ```

---

## Results
1. **Visualizations**:
- Seasonal adoption trends.
- Shelter stay durations by intake type.
2. **Machine Learning Performance**:
- Best model: XGBoost (F1-Score: 0.87).
- PCA impact: Reduced training time for linear models.
3. **Recommendations**:
- Unique names generated for pets based on attributes.
